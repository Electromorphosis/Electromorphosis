👋 Hi, I’m Pawel. I live in Northern Poland. 
👀 I was always a bit of a computer geek. I started getting more serious into programming in 2019 when I started to learn C; I'm interested in many things, but notably: gamedev, data science, cognitive psychology & neuroscience.  
🌱 I’m currently learning python and Pytest framework.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various interesting projects (currently without specific preferences, just to gain more expertise). 
📫 How to reach me: @Discord 'Ether sailor Nox#4207'
