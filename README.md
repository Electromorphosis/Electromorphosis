Human being, tinkering with computers since ca. 2000;
from 2021 I also do it profesionally.

My favourite computer-related topics are: 
    Machine cognition,
    Automation,
    games, esp. sandboxes/building/strategic,
    human-computer interactions,
    generative processes & fractals;
    systems theory.

What's published in my repository as of now:
- Script for quick batch analysis of data obtained from Psytoolkit. It's working, but it is also my early project written in C. Much fun to write, not much use as of now. It sits here mostly for historical reasons.
- Garden game: a title is self-explanatory. It is an early alpha version, so already playable, but still needs a few more tweaks and more content. Plant pixel art flowers on a randomly generated tilemap, gain cash, buy gnomes -> profit!  
- Some python doodles.
