Human being, playing with computers since c.a. year 2000;
Since 2019 I started transforming hobby into craft;

My favourite computer-related topics are: 
    mechanical cognition (AI etc.),
    automatization (sparing resources such as time or cognition),
    games, esp. sandboxes & RTS's,
    human-computer interactions, (incl. BCI's & futurism)
    computational modeling in life science,
    system theory.
