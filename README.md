Playing with computers since year 2000;
Since 2019 transforming Hobby into Craft;
I fondly seek for new solutions and ways to make life easier;

My favourite technical topics are: 
    mechanical cognition (AKA AI),
    automatization,
    games, esp. sandboxes & RTS,
    human-computer interactions,
    computers in life science.

I'm always glad to meet new people & learn new things!
