Human being, playing with computers since ca. year 2000;
since ca. 2019 I started taking it a bit more serious...

My favourite computer-related topics are: 
    Thinking Things (or Things that Think),
    automating things (less work = more slack),
    games, esp. sandboxes/building/strategic,
    human-computer interactions, 
    generative processes, fractals,
    systems theory.

What you can find in my repository as of now:
- Script for quick batch analysis of data obtained from Psytoolkit. It's working, but it is also my early project written in C, so it's rather crude. Maybe one day I refine it, but currently it doesn't have high priority for me (if any at all),
- Some python doodles. As of now most of them are just some exercises.
