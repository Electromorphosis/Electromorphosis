Human being, tinkering with computers since ca. 2000;
from 2021 I also do it professionally.

My favourite computer-related topics are: 
    machine cognition,
    automation,
    games, esp. sandboxes/construction/strategic,
    human-computer interactions,
    generative processes, fractals &
    systems theory.

What's published in my repository as of now:
- Script for quick batch analysis of data obtained from Psytoolkit. It's working, but it's also my very early project written in C. It was much fun to write, but it has not much use as of now. It sits here mostly for historical reasons.
- Garden game: a title is self-explanatory. It is an early alpha version, so already playable, but still needs a few more tweaks and more content. Plant pixel art flowers on a randomly generated tilemap, gain cash, buy gnomes -> profit!  
- Some python doodles, i.e. mostly implementations of some common functions.
